**Program: Writing student data to a binary file**

This program reads roll numbers and marks for 5 students and writes them to a binary file named "stu.dat" using `FileOutputStream` and `DataOutputStream`.

**Solved Problem: Extracting data from binary files**

This program reads "stu.dat" and creates a new binary file "Toppers.dat" containing only those students who scored more than 75%.
